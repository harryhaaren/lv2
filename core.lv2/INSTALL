This software requires only Python to build.

= LV2 Core package instructions =

This package contains a header file, pkg-config file, and an LV2 bundle;
there is no code that requires compiling (i.e. this is NOT a library).
Accordingly, the versioning scheme is simpler than a library: the major
number is the version number of the LV2 specification, and the minor
number is the version of this package.  There is no 'micro' number.

The configure option --bundle-only can be used to install only the bundle.
This can be used in conjunction with the --lv2-user option to install
only the bundle to the user-specific (i.e. in your home directory) LV2
path, if you do not have write access to the system.

Distribution packages should install everything, as apps may depend
on 'lv2core' (via pkg-config) to ensure both the header and data
bundle are present.


= Generic waf instructions =

Like an auto* project, building has three phases:


* Configure:       ./waf configure [OPTIONS]

  Example:
    ./waf configure --prefix=/some/where

  The default prefix is /usr/local


* Build:           ./waf [OPTIONS]

  Example:
    ./waf


* Install:         ./waf install [OPTIONS]

  The environment variable DESTDIR can be used to add any prefix to
  the install paths (useful for packaging).  Example:

  DESTDIR=/home/drobilla/packages ./waf install


*** IMPORTANT: You must use absolute paths everywhere


Run './waf --help' for detailed option information.

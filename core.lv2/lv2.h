/** @file lv2.h
 * C header for the LV2 specification <http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core>.
 * Revision: 1
 *
 * == Overview ==
 *
 * There are a large number of open source and free software synthesis
 * packages in use or development at this time. This API ('LV2')
 * attempts to give programmers the ability to write simple 'plugin'
 * audio processors in C/C++ and link them dynamically ('plug') into
 * a range of these packages ('hosts').  It should be possible for any
 * host and any plugin to communicate completely through this interface.
 *
 * This API is deliberately as short and simple as possible.
 * The information required to use a plugin is in a companion data
 * (RDF) file.  The shared library portion of the API (defined in this
 * header) does not contain enough information to make use of the plugin
 * possible - the data file is mandatory.
 *
 * Plugins are expected to distinguish between control rate and audio
 * rate data (or other types of data defined by extensions). Plugins have
 * 'ports' that are inputs or outputs and each plugin is 'run' for a 'block'
 * corresponding to a short time interval measured in samples. Audio rate
 * data is communicated using arrays with one element per sample processed,
 * allowing a block of audio to be processed by the plugin in a single
 * pass. Control rate data is communicated using single values. Control
 * rate data has a single value at the start of a call to the 'run()'
 * function, and may be considered to remain this value for its duration.
 * Thus the 'control rate' is determined by the block size, controlled by
 * the host.  The plugin may assume that all its input and output ports have
 * been connected to the relevant data location (see the 'connect_port()'
 * function below) before it is asked to run, unless the port has been set
 * 'connection optional' in the plugin's data file.
 *
 * Plugins will reside in shared object files suitable for dynamic linking
 * by dlopen() and family. The file will provide a number of 'plugin
 * types' that can be used to instantiate actual plugins (sometimes known
 * as 'plugin instances') that can be connected together to perform tasks.
 * The host can access these plugin types using the lv2_descriptor()
 * function.
 *
 * This API contains very limited error-handling.
 *
 * == Threading rules ==
 *
 * Certain hosts may need to call the functions provided by a plugin from
 * multiple threads. For this to be safe, the plugin must be written so that
 * those functions can be executed simultaneously without problems.
 * To facilitate this, the functions provided by a plugin are divided into
 * classes:
 *
 *  - Discovery class:     lv2_descriptor(), extension_data()
 *  - Instantiation class: instantiate(), cleanup(), activate(), deactivate()
 *  - Audio class:         run(), connect_port()
 *
 * Extensions to this specification which add new functions MUST declare in
 * which of these classes the functions belong, or define new classes for them.
 * The rules that hosts must follow are these:
 *
 *  - When a function from the Discovery class is running, no other
 *    functions in the same shared object file may run.
 *  - When a function from the Instantiation class is running for a plugin
 *    instance, no other functions for that instance may run.
 *  - When a function is running for a plugin instance, no other
 *    function in the same class may run for that instance.
 *
 * Any simultaneous calls that are not explicitly forbidden by these rules
 * are allowed. For example, a host may call run() for two different plugin
 * instances simultaneously.
 */

/** Plugin Handle.
 *
 * This plugin handle indicates a particular instance of the plugin
 * concerned. It is valid to compare this to NULL (0 for C++) but
 * otherwise the host MUST NOT attempt to interpret it. The plugin
 * may use it to reference internal instance data. */
typedef void * LV2_Handle;


/* ************************************************************************* */


/** Feature data.
 *
 * These are passed to a plugin's instantiate method to represent a special
 * feature the host has which the plugin may depend on.  This is to allow
 * extensions to the LV2 specification without causing any breakage.
 * Extensions may specify what data needs to be passed here.  The base
 * LV2 specification does not define any features; hosts are not required
 * to use this facility. */
typedef struct _LV2_Feature {
	/** A globally unique, case-sensitive identifier for this feature.
	 *
	 * This MUST be defined in the specification of any LV2 extension which
	 * defines a host feature. */
	const char * URI;

	/** Pointer to arbitrary data.
	 *
	 * This is to allow hosts to pass data to a plugin (simple values, data
	 * structures, function pointers, etc) as part of a 'feature'.  The LV2
	 * specification makes no restrictions on the contents of this data.
	 * The data here MUST be cleary defined by the LV2 extension which defines
	 * this feature.
	 * If no data is required, this may be set to NULL. */
	void * data;
} LV2_Feature;


/* ************************************************************************* */


/** Descriptor for a Type of Plugin.
 *
 * This structure is used to describe a plugin type. It provides a number
 * of functions to instantiate it, link it to buffers and run it. */
typedef struct _LV2_Descriptor {

	/** A globally unique, case-sensitive identifier for this plugin type.
	 *
	 * All plugins with the same URI MUST be compatible in terms of 'port
	 * signature', meaning they have the same number of ports, same port
	 * shortnames, and roughly the same functionality.  URIs should
	 * probably contain a version number (or similar) for this reason.
	 *
	 * Rationale:  When serializing session/patch/etc files, hosts MUST
	 * refer to a loaded plugin by the plugin URI only.  In the future
	 * loading a plugin with this URI MUST yield a plugin with the
	 * same ports (etc) which is 100% compatible. */
	const char * URI;

	/** Function pointer that instantiates a plugin.
	 *
	 * A handle is returned indicating the new plugin instance. The
	 * instantiation function accepts a sample rate as a parameter as well
	 * as the plugin descriptor from which this instantiate function was
	 * found. This function must return NULL if instantiation fails.
	 *
	 * bundle_path is a string of the path to the LV2 bundle which contains
	 * this plugin binary.  It MUST include the trailing directory separator
	 * (e.g. '/') so that BundlePath + filename gives the path to a file
	 * in the bundle.
	 *
	 * features is a NULL terminated array of LV2_Feature structs which
	 * represent the features the host supports. Plugins may refuse to
	 * instantiate if required features are not found here (however hosts
	 * SHOULD NOT use this as a discovery mechanism, instead reading the
	 * data file before attempting to instantiate the plugin).  This array
	 * must always exist; if a host has no features, it MUST pass a single
	 * element array containing NULL (to simplify plugins).
	 *
	 * Note that instance initialisation should generally occur in
	 * activate() rather than here.  If a host calls instantiate, it MUST
	 * call cleanup() at some point in the future. */

	/** Function pointer that connects a port on a plugin instance to a memory
	 * location where the block of data for the port will be read/written.
	 *
	 * The data location is expected to be of the type defined in the
	 * plugin's data file (e.g. an array of float for an lv2:AudioPort).
	 * Memory issues are managed by the host. The plugin must read/write
	 * the data at these locations every time run() is called, data
	 * present at the time of this connection call MUST NOT be
	 * considered meaningful.
	 *
	 * The host MUST NOT try to connect a data buffer to a port index
	 * that is not defined in the RDF data for the plugin. If it does,
	 * the plugin's behaviour is undefined.
	 *
	 * connect_port() may be called more than once for a plugin instance
	 * to allow the host to change the buffers that the plugin is reading
	 * or writing. These calls may be made before or after activate()
	 * or deactivate() calls.  Note that there may be realtime constraints
	 * on connect_port (see lv2:hardRTCapable in lv2.ttl).
	 *
	 * connect_port() MUST be called at least once for each port before
	 * run() is called.  The plugin must pay careful attention to the block
	 * size passed to the run function as the block allocated may only just
	 * be large enough to contain the block of data (typically samples), and
	 * is not guaranteed to be constant.
	 *
	 * Plugin writers should be aware that the host may elect to use the
	 * same buffer for more than one port and even use the same buffer for
	 * both input and output (see lv2:inPlaceBroken in lv2.ttl).
	 * However, overlapped buffers or use of a single buffer for both
	 * audio and control data may result in unexpected behaviour.
	 *
	 * If the plugin has the feature lv2:hardRTCapable then there are
	 * various things that the plugin MUST NOT do within the connect_port()
	 * function (see lv2.ttl). */

	 * and then activate(). In this case the plugin instance must reset all

	 * to the run() call as possible and indicates to real-time plugins
	 * that they are now live, however plugins MUST NOT rely on a prompt
	 * call to run() after activate().  activate() may not be called again
	 * unless deactivate() is called first (after which activate() may be
	 * called again, followed by deactivate, etc. etc.).  If a host calls

	 * before run(). If deactivate() is called for a plugin instance then
	 * the plugin instance may not be reused until activate() has been

	 * for the last time. This call SHOULD be made as close to the last

	 * deactivation. Note that connect_port() may be called before or

	 * precisely by the extension if it defines any extra data.  If a particular
	 * extension does not define extra instance data, this function MUST return
	 * NULL for that extension's URI.  If a plugin does not support any
	 * extensions that define extra instance data, this function pointer may be
	 * set to NULL rather than providing an empty function.
	 *
	 * The only parameter is the URI of the extension. The plugin MUST return
	 * NULL if it does not support the extension, but hosts SHOULD NOT use this
	 * as a discovery method (e.g. hosts should only call this function for
	 * extensions known to be supported by the plugin from the data file).
	 *
	 * The host is never responsible for freeing the returned value.
	 *
	 * NOTE: This function should return a struct (likely containing function
	 * pointers) and NOT a direct function pointer.  Standard C and C++ do not
	 * allow type casts from void* to a function pointer type.  To provide
	 * additional functions a struct should be returned containing the extra
	 * function pointers (which is valid standard code, and a much better idea
	 * for extensibility anyway). */

/** Accessing Plugin Types.
 *
 * The exact mechanism by which plugins are loaded is host-dependent,
 * however all most hosts will need to know is the URI of the plugin they
 * wish to load.  The environment variable LV2_PATH, if present, should
 * contain a colon-separated path indicating directories (containing
 * plugin bundle subdirectories) that should be searched (in order)
 * for plugins.  It is expected that hosts will use a library to provide
 * this functionality.
 *
 * A plugin programmer must include a function called "lv2_descriptor"
 * with the following function prototype within the shared object
 * file. This function will have C-style linkage (if you are using
 * C++ this is taken care of by the 'extern "C"' clause at the top of
 * the file).
 *
 * A host will find the plugin shared object file by one means or another,
 * find the lv2_descriptor() function, call it, and proceed from there.
 *
 * Plugin types are accessed by index (not ID) using values from 0
 * upwards. Out of range indexes must result in this function returning
 * NULL, so the plugin count can be determined by checking for the least
 * index that results in NULL being returned.  Index has no meaning,
 * hosts MUST NOT depend on it remaining constant (ie when serialising)
 * in any way. */

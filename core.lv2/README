LV2
---

LV2 gives programmers the ability to write audio processors (or "plugins") in
C/C++ which can be dynamically loaded into a range of applications (or
"hosts").

This core specification is deliberately as short and simple as possible, but is
designed so that extensions can be defined to add more advanced features.

More information about LV2 can be found at <http://lv2plug.in>.

Applications that use LV2 plugins should depend on this package. It includes a
header, pkg-config file, and lv2config (a header installation utility required
to compile against LV2 core and/or extensions). To compile against LV2, build
scripts can check for the pkg-config package "lv2core", or simply check for the
header "lv2/lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core/lv2.h".

Please package these components in a single package (e.g. do not split the
headers, data, and program into separate packages). This package, in its
entirety, is a build and run time dependency of any code that uses LV2.
Distributions are encouraged to include it with package name "lv2core". Note
that lv2config must be run after installation of any LV2 specifications,
including this one.

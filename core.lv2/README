LV2
---

LV2 is a standard for plugins and matching host applications, primarily
targeted at audio processing and generation.

LV2 is a successor to LADSPA, created to address the limitations of LADSPA
which many applications have outgrown.  Compared to LADSPA, all plugin data
is moved from the code to a separate data file, and the code has been made as
generic as possible.  As a result, LV2 can be independently extended
(retaining compatibility wherever possible), and virtually any feasible
plugin features can be implemented in an LV2 plugin.

More information about LV2 can be found at <http://lv2plug.in>.

This package is the "core" LV2 specification in usual source package form.
The major version of this package refers to the LV2 specification revision
contained, while the minor version refers only to this package.

Application authors aren't required to depend on this package (including lv2.h
in source distributions is acceptable) but any system with LV2 plugins should
have the LV2 bundle contained in this package installed somewhere in the LV2
path (it contains plugin classes and other useful information).

Please see README file for installation instructions (this package doesn't
really fit into the usual 'library', 'program', etc. categories).

Distributions are encouraged to include this package.

This software requires only Python to build. The build system, based on waf,
is included in this source distribution.

= LV2Core =

This package contains everything necessary to compile against and/or use LV2
plugins and extensions: a header file, pkg-config file, and LV2 bundle (with
Turtle files).

The configure option --bundle-only can be used to install only the bundle. This
is useful for installing the bundle to a project-specific or user-specific
location (e.g. ~/.lv2).

See README for details on how to correctly package LV2, and how to depend on
LV2 in other projects.

= Generic Waf Instructions =

As with most build systems, building and installing a project with waf is done
in three separate stages:

Configure: ./waf configure [OPTIONS]
     e.g.: ./waf configure --prefix=/some/where

  The default prefix is /usr/local


Build: ./waf [OPTIONS]
 e.g.: ./waf


Install: ./waf install [OPTIONS]
   e.g.: ./waf install
   e.g.:  DESTDIR=/home/drobilla/packages ./waf install

  The environment variable DESTDIR can be used to add any prefix to
  the install paths (useful for packaging).

  
Run './waf --help' for detailed option information.

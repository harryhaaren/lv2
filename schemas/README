This directory contains third-party vocabularies used in these LV2
specifications.  They are occasionally very slightly modified for validity, but
are otherwise equivalent to their original versions.

These are included here mainly to make validation without web fetching
possible, e.g. via sord_validate.

The XML schema description in xsd.ttl is an exception, it was mostly
hand-crafted since a good description of XSD in RDF did not seem to exist.  The
way it uses xsd:pattern is questionable, but simple and supported by
sord_validate.

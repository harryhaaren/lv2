This software requires only Python to build. The build system, based on waf,
is included in this source distribution.


LV2Core
=======

This package contains everything necessary to compile against and/or use LV2
plugins and extensions: a header file, pkg-config file, and LV2 bundle (with
Turtle files).

The configure option --bundle-only can be used to install only the lv2core.lv2
bundle.  This is useful for installing the bundle to a project-specific or
user-specific location (e.g. ~/.lv2).

See README for details on how to correctly package LV2, and how to depend on
LV2 in other projects.


Generic Waf Instructions
========================

As with most build systems, building and installing a project with waf is done
in three separate stages:

 1. ./waf configure [OPTIONS]
 2. ./waf build
 3. ./waf install

The default command is build.  For example:

    ./waf configure --prefix=/some/where
    ./waf -j2
    sudo ./waf install

The environment variable DESTDIR can be used to add a prefix to all install
paths (useful for packaging), for example:

    DESTDIR=./lv2core.pkg ./waf install
  
Run './waf --help' for detailed option information.

LV2
===

LV2 gives programmers the ability to write audio processors (or "plugins") in
C/C++ which can be dynamically loaded into a range of applications (or
"hosts").

This core specification is deliberately as short and simple as possible, but is
designed so that extensions can be defined to add more advanced features.

More information about LV2 can be found at <http://lv2plug.in>.


Using LV2
---------

Applications that use LV2 plugins should depend on this package.  It includes a
header, LV2 bundle, and a pkg-config file.  To compile against LV2, build
scripts should check for the pkg-config package "lv2core", or simply check for
the header "lv2/lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core/lv2.h".

The appropriate C include for LV2 specifications is based on their URI, e.g.:

    #include "lv2/lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core/lv2.h"

Is how code should include the header "lv2.h" in this bundle, which defines the
specification with URI "http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core".  Other specifications
should follow this convention, e.g. the correct way to include the header
"foo.h" in the extension "http://example.org/foo" is:

    #include "lv2/example.org/foo/foo.h"


Packaging
---------

Please package these components in a single package (i.e. do not split the
headers, data, and program into separate packages).  This package, in its
entirety, is a build and run time dependency of any code that uses LV2.
Distributions are encouraged to include it with package name "lv2core".

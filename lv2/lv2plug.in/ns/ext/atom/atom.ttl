<p>This extension defines a generic container for data, called an <q>Atom</q>,
and several basic Atom types which can be used to express structured data.
Atoms are (with one exception) Plain Old Data (POD), which means they can be
easily copied generically (e.g. using <code>memcpy</code>), and are suitable
for use in high-performance and real-time code.</p>

<p>Since Atom communication can be implemented generically, plugins that
understand some type can be used together in a host that does not understand
that type.  Similarly, plugins (such as routers, delays, or data stores) can
meaningfully process atoms of a type unknown to them.</p>

<p>Atoms can and should be used anywhere values of various types must be stored
or transmitted.  This extension defines a port type, atom:AtomPort, for
transmitting atoms via ports.  The atom:Sequence type in an atom:AtomPort
replaces the <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/event">LV2 event</a>
extension.</p>

<p>The types defined in this extension should be powerful enough to express
almost any structure.  Implementations SHOULD build structures out of the types
provided here, rather than define new binary formats (e.g. use atom:Object
rather than a new C <code>struct</code> type).  New binary formats are an
implementation burden which harms interoperabilty, and should only be defined
where absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Implementing this extension requires a facility for mapping URIs to
integers, such as the <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/urid">LV2 URID</a>
extension.</p>

<p>All atoms are POD by definition except references, which as a special case
have <code>type = 0</code>.  An Atom MUST NOT contain a Reference.  It is safe
to copy any non-reference Atom with a simple <code>memcpy</code>, even if the
implementation does not understand <code>type</code>.  Though this extension
reserves the type 0 for references, the details of reference handling are
currently unspecified.  A future revision of this extension, or a different
extension, may define how to use non-POD data and references.  Implementations
MUST NOT send references to another implementation unless the receiver is
explicitly known to support references (e.g. by supporting a feature).  The

<p>This is a vocabulary for precisely describing a position in time and the
passage of time itself, in both real and musical terms.</p>

<p>In addition to real time (e.g. seconds), two units of time are used:
<q>frames</q> and <q>beats</q>.  A frame is a numbered quantum of time.  Frame
time is related to real-time by the <q>frame rate</q> or <q>sample rate</q>, <a
href="#framesPerSecond">time:framesPerSecond</a>.  A beat is a single pulse of
musical time.  Beat time is related to real-time by the <q>tempo</q>, <a
href="#beatsPerMinute">time:beatsPerMinute</a>.</p>

<p>Musical time additionally has a <q>meter</q> which describes passage of time
in terms of musical <q>bars</q>.  A bar is a higher level grouping of beats.
The meter describes how many beats are in one bar.</p>

	lv2:documentation """
<p>This extension defines a facility for plugins to get information about the
block length (the sample_count parameter of LV2_Descriptor::run) and
port buffer sizes, as well as several features which can be used to restrict
the block length.</p>

<p>The host provides access to all the relevant information via the
bufsz:access feature.</p>

<p>To require restrictions on the block length, plugins can require additional
features: bufsz:boundedBlockLength, bufsz:powerOf2BlockLength, and
bufsz:fixedBlockLength.  These features are data-only, that is they merely
indicate a restriction and do not carry any data or API.</p>

<p>The feature that provides access to buffer size information.  This feature
is the only one in this extension which carries data: to implement it the host
passes a feature with URI LV2_BUF_SIZE__access and an LV2_Buf_Size_Access
for data, which provides functions the plugin can call to investigate the
buffer size.</p>

<p>A feature that indicates the host will provide a minimum and maximum block
length via LV2_Buf_Size_Access::get_sample_count().  Plugins that copy data
from audio inputs can require this feature to ensure they know how much space
is required for auxilliary buffers.  Note the minimum may be zero, this feature
is mainly useful to ensure a maximum is available.</p>

<p>All hosts SHOULD support this feature, since it is simple to support and
necessary for plugins to create auxiliary buffers.</p>

<p>This extension defines a facility for <q>options</q>, which are parameters
passed to a plugin, UI, or other instance at instantiation time.  Like the
command-line <em>options</em> of a program, options do not change over the
lifetime of an instance.</p>

<p>Because they are available at instantiation time, options are useful for
adding parameters which are not suitable for dynamic control, such as those
that require expensive pre-computation.  They are also useful for providing
information which would not otherwise be available.</p>

<p>Options are provided to instances by the host via the opts:options
feature.</p>

<p>Instances may indicate they <q>require</q> an option with the
opts:requiredOption property, or that they optionally <q>support</q> an option
with the opts:supportedOption property.</p>

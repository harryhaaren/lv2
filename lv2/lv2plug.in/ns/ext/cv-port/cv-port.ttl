<p>This extension defines Control Voltage (CV) ports, which are audio-rate
control ports like those used on classical voltage-controlled synthesizers.
These ports serve as control ports like <a
href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#ControlPort">lv2:ControlPort</a> but can
also be used for audio-rate modulation of control signals.  This enables many
types of processing and synthesis which are not possible with a lower control
rate.</p>

<p>Ports of this type have identical semantics to <a
href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#AudioPort">lv2:AudioPort</a> in terms of
buffer format and connection/input/output logistics.  However, rather than the
buffer representing audio, the buffer represents audio-rate control data.  A
CVPort SHOULD have the same properties a <a
href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#ControlPort">lv2:ControlPort</a> typically
has to describe appropriate control values (e.g.  <a
href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#minimum">lv2:minimum</a>, <a
href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#maximum">lv2:maximum</a>, <a
href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#default">lv2:default</a>)</p>

<p>Hosts SHOULD take care to prevent data from a CVPort port from being used as
audio except in cases where this is known to be safe.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="turtle-code">

    lv2:port [
        a cv:CVPort, lv2:InputPort ;
        lv2:index 0 ;
        lv2:minimum -1.0 ;
        lv2:maximum 1.0 ;
        lv2:default 0.0 ;
        lv2:symbol "modulation" ;
        lv2:name "Modulation" ;

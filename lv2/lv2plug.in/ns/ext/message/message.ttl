	lv2:documentation """
<p>This extension defines messages which can be used to access and manipulate
property-based data.  It is designed to provide a powerful dynamic control
interface for LV2 plugins, but is useful for RDF-like systems in general.</p>

<p>The main feature of this design is that requests and responses are
themselves completely described in RDF.  Thus, the complete <q>protocol</q> can
be expressed wherever RDF can without imposing additional implementation
burdens like a new syntax or binary formats.  In particular, messages can be
serialised in Turtle, or as an <a
href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/atom#Object">LV2 Object</a>.</p>

<p>This set of message types is deliberately small to avoid an explosion of
messages that all implementations would have to explicitly support.  Instead,
the idea is to achieve control via manipulating properties rather than defining
custom commands.  However, this is conceptual; there is no requirement that the
receiver actually implement a store of resources with properties.</p>

<p>For example, consider an object that can blink.  Rather than define a
specific interface to control this (e.g. <code>obj.start_blinking();
obj.stop_blinking()</code>), set a <q>blinking</q> property to true or false to
achieve the desired behaviour.  One benefit of this approach is that a
persistent state model is available <q>for free</q>: simply serialise the
<q>blinking</q> property.</p>

<p>Because changes are described in terms of properties, important
functionality like undo stacks or revision control are simple to implement
generically.  Accordingly, plugins are strongly encouraged to use these
property-based messages rather than defining custom methods for every action
they require (or worse, defining entirely new formats for messages).</p>

<p>These methods are deliberately very similar to HTTP methods, but defined
specifically for property-based resources.  The <q>properties</q> used here are
RDF properties, thus predicates from any of the countless pre-existing
vocabularies may be used.</p>

msg:Get
	a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf msg:Request ;

	lv2:documentation """
<p>Request a description of the subject.</p>

<p>The detail of the response is not specified, it may be a flat description of
all the properties of the subject, or a more expressive description with
several subjects.  A good choice is a <q><a
href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/CBD/">concise bounded description</a></q>,
i.e. a description which recursively includes all properties with blank node
values.</p>

<p>The response should have the same msg:subject property as the request, and
a msg:body that is a description of that subject.  For example:</p>
<pre class="turtle-code">
&lt;get-request&gt;
    a msg:Get ;
    msg:subject &lt;something&gt; .
</pre>

<p>Could result in:</p>
<pre class="turtle-code">
[]
    a msg:Response ;
    msg:request &lt;get-request&gt; ;
    msg:subject &lt;something&gt; ;
    msg:body [
        eg:name "Something" ;
        eg:ratio 1.6180339887 ;
    ] .
</pre>

<p>Note the use of blank nodes is not required; the value of msg:body may be
the actual resource node.  Depending on the transport and syntax used this may
be preferable.  However, the msg:subject property is required regardless.  For
example, the same response could be written:</p>

<pre class="turtle-code">
&lt;something&gt;
    eg:name "Something" ;
    eg:ratio 1.6180339887 .

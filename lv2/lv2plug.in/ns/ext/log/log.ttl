<p>This extension defines a feature, log:log, which allows plugins to print log
messages with an API much like the standard C printf functions.  This allows,
for example, plugin logs to be nicely presented to the user in a graphical user
interface.</p>

<p>Different log <q>levels</q> (e.g. <q>error</q> or <q>information</q>) are
defined by URI and passed as an LV2_URID.  Thus, the possible number of log
levels is unlimited, but implementations SHOULD use the levels defined in this
extension unless they have a special reason to do otherwise.</p>

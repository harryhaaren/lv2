	lv2:documentation """
This extension defines a simple mechanism for plugins to map URIs to and from
integers, usually for performance reasons (e.g. processing events typed by URIs
in real time).  Typically, plugins map URIs to integers for things they
"understand" at instantiation time, and store those values for use in the audio
thread without doing any string comparison.  This allows for the extensibility
of RDF but with the performance of integers.

This extension is intended as an improved and simpler replacement for the
<a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/uri-map">uri-map</a> extension, since the
<q>map</q> context parameter has been found problematic.

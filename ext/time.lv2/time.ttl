Type for an LV2_Time_Position struct.  This can be mapped to an integer and
used as the type field of an event to indicate that the event payload is an
LV2_Time_Positon struct.  Plugins SHOULD indicate that a port supports time
information using the ev:supports predicate, e.g.:
<pre class="turtle-code">
&lt;plugin&gt; lv2:port [
    a lv2:InputPort , ev:EventPort ;
    lv2:name "control" ;
    lv2:index 0 ;

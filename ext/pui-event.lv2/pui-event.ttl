<ol>
<li>This PortProtocol is valid for ports with the type ev:EventPort.</li>
<li>The host MUST call port_event() whenever there is an event in an input port
    prior to the plugin instance's run() function is called, and whenever there
    is an event in an output port after run() has been called. The UI MUST NOT
    depend on the timing of the calls. However, the host MUST do the calls in
    the same order that the events occur in. The host is allowed and encouraged
    to bundle multiple events into a single port_event() call if it improves
    performance.</li>
<li>The data buffer passed to port_event() is an LV2_Event_Buffer, as specified
    in the Event extension. The stamp_type MUST be ignored. The frames and
    subframes fields of every event in the buffer MUST be ignored. Events with
    type 0 (reference counted events) MUST be ignored.</li>
<li>The data buffer passed to write_event() is an LV2_Event_Buffer, as
    specified in the Event extension. The stamp_type MUST be ignored. The
    frames and subframes fields of every event in the buffer MUST be
    ignored. The host MUST NOT pass events with type 0 (references) unless the
    UI supports the feature "http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/event".</li>
<li>The host MUST pass all the events in the buffer to the plugin instance's
    event port in the same order, but the plugin and the UI MUST NOT depend on
    the timing of the events, or on whether they are all sent to the plugin in
    the same run() call or distributed over multiple calls.</li>
<li>The data pointer in the LV2_Feature object for this feature should be
    NULL.</li>

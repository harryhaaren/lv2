# Hosts and plugins that used that extension should use this one instead.
# The earlier in-process UI extension is not compatible with LV2 revision 3
# and later and may break in subtle ways.

<ol>
<li>This PortProtocol is valid for ports with the type ev:EventPort.</li>
<li>The host MUST call port_event() whenever there is an event in an input
    port prior to the plugin instance's run() function is called, and whenever
    there is an event in an output port after run() has been called. The
    UI MUST NOT depend on the timing of the calls. However, the host MUST
    do the calls in the same order that the events occur in. The host is
    allowed and encouraged to bundle multiple events into a single port_event()
    call if it improves performance.</li>
<li>The data buffer passed to port_event() is an LV2_Event_Buffer, as specified
    in the Event extension. The stamp_type MUST be ignored. The frames and
    subframes fields of every event in the buffer MUST be ignored. Events
    with type 0 (reference counted events) MUST be ignored.</li>
<li>The data buffer passed to write_event() is an LV2_Event_Buffer, as specified
    in the Event extension. The stamp_type MUST be ignored. The frames and
    subframes fields of every event in the buffer MUST be ignored. Events
    with type 0 MUST NOT be written to the buffer.</li>
<li>The host MUST pass all the events in the buffer to the plugin instance's
    event port in the same order, but the plugin and the UI MUST NOT depend on
    the timing of the events, or on whether they are all sent to the plugin in
    the same run() call or distributed over multiple calls.</li>
<li>The data pointer in the LV2_Feature object for this feature should be
    NULL.</li>

<p>An extension that allows LV2 plugins to request a resize of an output port.</p>

<p>Any host which supports this extension must pass an LV2_Feature to
the plugin's instantiate method with URI http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/resize-port
and a pointer to a LV2_Resize_Port_Feature structure (see
<a href="resize-port.h">resize-port.h</a> for details).  This structure
provides a resize_port function which plugins may use to resize output
port buffers as necessary.</p>

<p>This extension also defines several predicates useful for describing the
amount of space required for a particular port buffer.</p>

    rdfs:comment """
Indicates that a port requires at least as much buffer space as the port
with the given symbol on the same plugin instance.  This may be used for
any ports, but is generally most useful to indicate an output port must
be at least as large as some input port (because it will copy from it).
If a port is asLargeAs several ports, it is asLargeAs the largest such port
(not the sum of those ports' sizes).

The host guarantees that whenever an ObjectPort's run method is called,
any output O that is obj:asLargeAs an input I is connected to a buffer large
enough to copy I, or NULL if the port is lv2:connectionOptional.

Indicates that a port requires a buffer at least this large, in bytes.
Any host that supports the resize-port feature MUST connect any port with a
minimumSize specified to a buffer at least as large as the value given for
this property.  Any host, especially those that do NOT support dynamic port
resizing, SHOULD do so or reduced functionality may result.

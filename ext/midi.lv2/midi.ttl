This extension defines a data type for a MIDI message (<a
href="#MidiEvent">MidiEvent</a>), which is normalized for fast and convenient
processing by plugins.  It is particularly useful as the payload of an <a

<p>A single raw MIDI message (i.e. a sequence of bytes).</p>

<p>These is equivalent to a standard MIDI messages, except with the following
restrictions to simplify handling:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Running status is not allowed, every message must have its own status
  byte.</li>

  <li>Note On messages with velocity 0 are not allowed.  These messages are
  equivalent to Note Off in standard MIDI streams, but here only proper Note
  Off messages are allowed.</li>

  <li>"Realtime messages" (status bytes 0xF8 to 0xFF) are allowed, but may
  not occur inside other messages like they can in standard MIDI streams.</li>

  <li>All messages are complete valid MIDI messages.  This means, for example,
  that only the first byte in each event (the status byte) may have the eighth
  bit set, that Note On and Note Off events are always 3 bytes long, etc.
  Where messages are communicated, the writer is responsible for writing valid
  messages, and the reader may assume that all events are valid.</li>
</ul>

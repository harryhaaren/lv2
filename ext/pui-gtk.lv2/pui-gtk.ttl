<p>The class which represents a Gtk+ UI. For a successfully created instance of
an UI of this class, the get_widget() function MUST return a pointer to a valid
GtkWidget object compatible with Gtk+ version 2.0. The host MUST ensure that
the Gtk+ library has been initialised and that the Glib main loop is running
before an UI of this type is instantiated.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified by extensions, all function pointers in
LV2_PUI_Descriptor may only be called from the thread that runs the Glib main
loop.</p>

<p>This Feature should only be used with UIs.</p>

<p>When this Feature is active the host SHOULD NOT resize the UI widget to any
other size than the one given by gtk_widget_size_request(). However, the UI
MUST NOT break if the widget is resized to another size. This Feature can be
used for example when the widget uses a fixed-size pixmap interface.</p>

<p>The data pointer in the LV2_Feature object for this Feature should be set to
NULL.</p>

This extension defines the format for "messages" which can be used to
dynamically control an LV2 plugin instance at runtime.  Messages are useful
for any kind of plugin control that does not fit well with control ports.
Plugins can both receive and send messages (and thus send messages to each
other) via any mechanism.

This extension requires the host to support the <a
href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/uri-map">LV2 URI Map</a> extension, and the
<a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/atom">LV2 Atom</a> extension.

	rdfs:comment """
Base class for all types of LV2 Message.

A type of message, which must be a resource (i.e. have a URI).  This URI
is used as the selector component of a Message and is used by receivers
to interpret the meaning of messages (e.g. which components are present).
""" .

message:Message a atom:AtomType ;
	rdfs:label "Message" ;
	rdfs:comment """
A message is a communication from one component to another.  Messages consist
of a selector URI, and a key/value dictionary.  Keys in the dictionary are
URI mapped integers, and values are Atoms. The selector URI dictates how
the message is to be interpreted (e.g. the selector can be used as a "verb"
to build commands).

Messages are simple to serialise in many different formats (e.g. any RDF
serialisation including LV2 Turtle files, JSON, XML, etc) making network
transparency and persistence simple, assuming the implementation can
serialise Atoms.

Because all messages have a standard format, plugins and hosts can store,
communicate, or otherwise work with messages even if they do not understand
that particular message's selector.

In memory, a Message is simply a uint32_t selector (a URI mapped integer)
followed by an atom:Blank.

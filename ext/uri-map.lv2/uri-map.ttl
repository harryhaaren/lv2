    rdfs:comment """
This extension defines a simple mechanism for plugins to map URIs to integers,
usually for performance reasons (e.g. processing events typed by URIs in
real time).  The expected use case is for plugins to map URIs to integers for
things they 'understand' at instantiation time, and store those values for
use in the audio thread without doing any string comparison.  This allows
the extensibility of RDF with the performance of integers (or centrally
defined enumerations).

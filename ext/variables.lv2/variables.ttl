An extension for setting named/typed variables on an instance of an
LV2 Plugin (or anything else).  A "variable" is really just a (reified)
RDF statement with an implicit subject (e.g. the plugin instance).

Variables serve as a portable, network transparent, and serialisable
mechanism for clients (e.g. user interfaces, programs) to control any
parameter of a running plugin instance.  Because variables are 'keyed'
by URI (the predicate), future extensions can define variables with
specific meanings or restricted/extended types.
The value (rdf:value) of a variable may be anything, but hosts or plugins
aren't guaranteed to support anything other than simple typed literals.
Serialisation and code access to complex variables is considered outside
the scope of this extension.

Hosts and plugins SHOULD use the following types for appropriate values:

<table>
<tr><th>RDF Type</th><th>Data Type</th></tr>
<tr><td>xsd:string</td><td>string</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsd:decimal</td><td>floating point number</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsd:integer</td><td>integer number</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsd:boolean</td><td>boolean value</td></tr>
</table>

This extension does not currently define a code mechanism for access
to variables.  A future revision, or a different extension, may.

An example of a plugin with several variables:
<pre>
&lt;http://example.org/plugin&gt; a lv2:Plugin ;
	lv2var:variable [
		rdf:predicate &lt;http://example.org/greetingology#Greeting&gt; ;
		rdf:value "Hello, cruel world."
	] , [
		rdf:predicate &lt;http://example.org/matheybits#Coeff&gt; ;
		rdf:value 1.23456
	] , [
		rdf:predicate &lt;http://example.org/databits#BigValue&gt; ;
		rdf:value [
			a somext:Something ;
			someext:foo "Foo?" ;
			someext:bar "Bar." ;
			someext:baz 1234.0
		]
	] .
</pre>

Relates an LV2 Variable to some Resource, usually a plugin instance.

The range is implicitly an lv2var:Variable, the 'a lv2var:Variable' triple
